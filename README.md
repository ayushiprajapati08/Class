# Class
##Code 1
1. Start
2. Define a class named Cube with public data members: double height, width, and length.
3. Inside the class:
   a. Initialize height to 2.0, width to 3.0, and length to 5.0.
4. Define the main function:
   a. Declare an object of the Cube class: Cube cube1.
   b. Calculate the volume of the cube using the formula: volume = height * width * length.
   c. Output: "Volume: volume" followed by a newline.
5. End
The program starts and defines a class named Cube with public data members for height, width, and length.
The data members are initialized to specific values inside the class definition.
In the main function, an object of the Cube class, cube1, is created.
The volume of the cube is calculated by multiplying its height, width, and length.
The program outputs the calculated volume of the cube.
The program ends after displaying the volume.


##Code 2
1. Start
2. Define a class named Cube with public data members: double height, width, and length.
3. Inside the class:
   a. Define a member function volume() without any parameters:
      i. Declare a local variable v of type double.
      ii. Calculate the volume using the formula: v = height * width * length.
      iii. Return v.
4. Define the main function:
   a. Declare an object of the Cube class: Cube cube1.
   b. Call the volume() member function of cube1 and store the returned value in a variable vol.
   c. Output: "Volume: vol" followed by a newline.
5. End
The program starts and defines a class named Cube with public data members for height, width, and length.
Inside the class, a member function volume() is defined, which calculates and returns the volume of the cube using its data members.
In the main function, an object of the Cube class, cube1, is created.
The volume() member function of cube1 is called to calculate the volume of the cube.
The program outputs the calculated volume of the cube.
The program ends after displaying the volume.


##Code 3
1. Start
2. Define a class named Cube with public data members: double height, width, and length.
3. Inside the class:
   a. Define a member function volume() without any parameters:
      i. Declare a local variable v of type double.
      ii. Calculate the volume using the formula: v = height * width * length.
      iii. Return v.
   b. Define another member function disp_vol() with a parameter vol of type double:
      i. Output: "Volume : vol" followed by a newline.
4. Define the main function:
   a. Declare an object of the Cube class: Cube cube1.
   b. Call the volume() member function of cube1 and store the returned value in a variable vol.
   c. Call the disp_vol() member function of cube1, passing vol as an argument.
5. End
The program starts and defines a class named Cube with public data members for height, width, and length.
Inside the class, a member function volume() is defined, which calculates and returns the volume of the cube using its data members.
Another member function disp_vol() is defined, which takes a double parameter vol and outputs the volume.
In the main function, an object of the Cube class, cube1, is created.
The volume() member function of cube1 is called to calculate the volume of the cube and the result is stored in a variable vol.
The disp_vol() member function of cube1 is called, passing vol as an argument, to display the calculated volume of the cube.
The program ends after displaying the volume.
