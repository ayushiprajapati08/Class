# Class
##code 1
1. Start
2. Define a class named Cube with public data members: double height, width, and length.
3. Inside the class:
   a. Initialize height to 2.0, width to 3.0, and length to 5.0.
4. Define the main function:
   a. Declare an object of the Cube class: Cube cube1.
   b. Calculate the volume of the cube using the formula: volume = height * width * length.
   c. Output: "Volume: volume" followed by a newline.
5. End
The program starts and defines a class named Cube with public data members for height, width, and length.
The data members are initialized to specific values inside the class definition.
In the main function, an object of the Cube class, cube1, is created.
The volume of the cube is calculated by multiplying its height, width, and length.
The program outputs the calculated volume of the cube.
The program ends after displaying the volume.
